Please notice that this optimization is optional but strongly recommended.

The sample files of this folder (index-image-pagespeed.html and index-image-pagespeed.min.html) demonstrates how to use parser.js (production: parser.min.js) to achieve the highest pagespeed performance on:

Google Insigts
developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights

GTMetrix
gtmetrix.com

Pingdom
tools.pingdom.com

Web Page Test

===============================================

Comprove The Performance

- Upload all files of your pack to the server
- Upload the file index-image-pagespeed.min.html (located on this folder) to the same directory of all other HTML files
- Do a backup of the .htaccess file of your site (if you have one) 
- Upload the assets/htaccess/htaccess.txt file to the root folder of your site and rename it to .htaccess
- If you use a CDN, clean the cache
- Verify if you can access any of the HTML files of the templace on your browser (sample: http://www.yourserver.com/index.html)
- Access any of the Pagespeed tools listed above
- Copy the full URL address of index-image-pagespeed.min.html on your server and paste it on the input field located on the pagespeed sites

Your URL must be as follow (sample structure)

If you are uploading the files to the root folder of your domain:
http://your-domain.com/index-image-pagespeed.min.html

If you are uploading the files to a subdomain:
http://your-subdomain.your-domain.com/index-image-pagespeed.min.html

If you use https:
https://your-domain.com/index-image-pagespeed.min.html

==============================================

If you are using a CDN, like Cloudflare (it's free), your performance will be similar to ours, maybe better. The difference will depend exclusively of your server response.
